              <p class="header-copy">When approaching this problem, I knew personally from repeated use that our prototyping tool needed help, but <strong>one person's opinion isn't enough.</strong> Luckily we had two designers start very soon after this problem had been identified and I was able to lead user testing sessions. This was a unique opportunity because neither had figured out workarounds, but had some familiarity with the concept of a hotspot image based prototype.</p>

            <h2>Usability issues were losing customers</h2>
              <div class="small-12 medium-10 small-centered column">
                <p>One of the biggest issues customers encountered was the inability to selectively pin hotspots, which created a huge issue when making more detailed prototypes. This meant that menus that weren't persistent throughout the whole site would have to be done manually across multiple pages; a daunting task if over 100 images were uploaded.</p>

                <h5>Others included:</h5>
                <ul>
                  <li>Preview function was slow and took forever to load, it also opened a new tab.</li>
                  <li>onHover effects weren't clickable, which was frustrating when making dropdown menus.</li>
                  <li>It was hard to find the correct screen when leafing through 50+ images. No search or thumbnail previews available.</li>
                  <li>Assuming that the default interaction was onClick was confusing, "pin" was mistaken as the onClick interaction by the testers.</li>
                  <li>It was impossible to create mid-page menus since an interaction would load a new page and reset it to the top.</li>
                  <li>There was no quick way to "keep your place" while going through and making user flows.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

            <h3>User Testing: Prototype Creation</h3>
              <div class="small-12 medium-10 small-centered column">
                <h5>Prototype creation involved a 5 part wizard:</h5>
                <ol>
                  <li>Upload Screen</li>
                  <li>Creation</li>
                  <li>Feedback Type</li>
                  <li>Open or Closed</li>
                  <li>Finalize and Name</li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Main Takeaways from User Testing</h5>

                  <p><strong>Heavy usability issues were found within the creation step,</strong> which created most difficulties. We initially assumed that the testers would make it through the 5 steps, but it turned out that they could barely finish creation within a reasonable amount of time before asking to give up.</p>
                  <p>From there we reasoned that <strong>finishing the actual creation within a reasonable amount of time would derive the most value</strong> with our limited development availability. We decided to focus specifically on the hotspot menu.</p>

            <h3>Synthesized basic takeaways into sketches</h3>
              <div class="small-12 medium-10 small-centered column">
                <p>From there, <strong>we were going from sketches into the build phase.</strong> The styles were already existent, it was just a matter of getting the interface right.</p>
                <ul class="case-study-slider small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 text-center">
                  <li><img class="th" src="img/solidify-sketches/hotspot-1.png">Sketch 1</li>

            <br>
            <div class="small-12 medium-10 small-centered column">
              <p><strong>We had a one week window where the designer and the engineer were available</strong> to take the time to work with me to finish up these fixes. Within that week, since a lot of the styling was set we were able to add many useful features as detailed below with the comparison between the new and the old version of the menu:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Is it click by default?</li>
                      <li>It pins to everything</li>
                      <li>Standard gestures</li>
                      <li>Standard animations</li>

                <li>
                  <h5>New Menu Breakdown</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Shows that it's click or hover</li>
                      <li>Typeahead search for all fields</li>
                      <li>Mini thumbnails of uploaded images</li>
                      <li>onHover + onClick in a single hotspot; they can link to two different screens</li>
                      <li>Applying hotspots to multiple screens selectively, the new version of "pinning"</li>
                      <li>Introduced more verbose tooltips; sometimes the copy wasn't clear enough.</li>
                      <li>Added "keep scroll position"</li>
                      <li>Made a preview state that didn't open a new window.</li>
                      <li>Added "Shift+click" shortcut to ffwd to the linked screen of the hotspot.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
